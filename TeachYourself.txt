MENUSTRIP
To Create a menustrip, you will start by using this code --> MenuStrip YourVariableName = new MenuStrip()

MENUITEM
To Create a Menu Item, you will use --> ToolStripMenuItem VariableName = new ToolStripMenuItem --> (This means that 
you declared a tool called ToolStripMenuItem and you gave it whatever variable name to access it so let's leave it as VariableName.)

VariableName.Click += new EventHandler(VariableName_Click); --> (This means that the tool you just declared, it is going to be used by clicking on the tool
and you gave it a new event handler called (VariableName_Click));

menuStrip.Items.Add(VariableName) -> This entails that you are adding the menu item you just made to the menu strip which will be shown on the form
